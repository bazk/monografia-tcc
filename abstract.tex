Among several living beings observed in nature, those with self-organization capabilities stand out. In a collective way, these living beings can overcome their own physical and cognitive limitations in order to solve more complex and difficult tasks. Swarm robotics is an area of robotics concentrated into the apllication of similar concepts to solve problems in the robotics area. This work aims to evaluate several strategies and algorithms (utilizing evolutionary robotics) for synthesis of an autonomous robot controller whose purpose is to reproduce the path-formation collective behavior.\\
